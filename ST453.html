<b>Personal note to students:</b> Please do not feel intimidated about interacting with the me.  Regardless of how busy or stressed I may appear to you, teaching your class is a part of my job, and I take that very seriously.  I care deeply about the quality of your learning.  Please always reach out to me if you have questions, concerns, or need help.  I understand that it can be difficult and can even feel embarrassing to ask for help.  However, I was once in your position, and I promise to always treat you with respect, empathy, and kindness.  Nobody that ever did anything meaningful did so without first failing over and over again.
