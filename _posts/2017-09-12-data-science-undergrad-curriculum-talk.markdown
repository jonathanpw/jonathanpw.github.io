I recently gave [a talk](http://stat-or.unc.edu/event/stor-colloquium-iain-davis-unc-chapel-hill) to my department about my experiences and take aways from developing/teaching a new course: [STOR 390: Introduction to Data Science Course](https://idc9.github.io/stor390/). The talk is about both the new course and more generally some thoughts about the undergraduate statistics curriculum.

You can find the slides here: [**https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1XUaNIybiPD6OpTs-ou5baSUQYiUOJuafXQsvEwrChjc/edit**](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1XUaNIybiPD6OpTs-ou5baSUQYiUOJuafXQsvEwrChjc/edit). 

There will hopefully be a follow up article/blog post some day, but I think the slides convey the main messages. Many of the points are based existing literature which is linked to at the end along with other courses I found helpful to develop the class.
