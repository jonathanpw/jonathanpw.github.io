<b>Personal note to students:</b> Please do not feel intimidated about interacting with me.  Regardless of how busy or stressed I may appear to you, teaching your class is a part of my job, and I take that very seriously.  I care deeply about the quality of your learning.  Please always reach out to me if you have questions, concerns, or need help.  I understand that it can be difficult and can even feel embarrassing to ask for help.  However, I was once in your position, and I promise to always treat you with respect, empathy, and kindness.  Nobody that ever did anything meaningful did so without first failing over and over again.

<h3><i>Homework assignments</i></h3>
<br/>
<ul>
	
	
The intended pace is for you to finish each assignment within 1 week.  Each assignment should take approximately 6 hours to complete, since this is a 3 credit hour course; consistent with the federal definition of a credit hour (i.e., for the purpose of accreditation) representing a minimum of 2 hours of out of class student work for every 1 hour of credit (see <a href="https://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-02-20-17-definition-of-credit-hour/"><b>NCSU REG 02.20.17</b></a>).  If you find that a particular problem is taking especially long to solve, then move on to the other problems, and follow up with either the TA or myself for guidance on the problems you could not solve.
