\begin{enumerate}

\item(2 points) Prove that a (square) matrix that is both orthogonal and upper triangular must be a diagonal matrix.

\item(2 points) Suppose that $v_{1},\dots,v_{p} \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ are a set of linearly independent vectors, and $w_{1},\dots,w_{p} \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ are the orthogonal vectors obtained from $v_{1},\dots,v_{p}$ by the Gram-Schmidt process.  Furthermore, denote by $u_{1},\dots,u_{p}$ the normalized vectors corresponding to $w_{1},\dots,w_{p}$, and define the matrix $R \in \mathbb{R}^{p\times p}$ by
\[
R_{ij} :=
\begin{cases}
\|w_{j}\| & \text{if } i=j \\
\langle v_{j}, u_i\rangle & \text{if } i<j \\
0 & \text{if } i>j \\
\end{cases}.
\]
Prove that $V = UR$, where $V$ is the matrix with columns $v_{1},\dots,v_{p}$ and $U$ is the matrix with columns $u_{1},\dots,u_{p}$.

\item(2 points) In the notation of the previous problem, suppose that $p = n$.  Further, assume that $V = U_{1}R_{1} = U_{2}R_{2}$, where $U_{1}$ and $U_{2}$ are orthogonal matrices and $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$ are upper triangular.  Prove that the matrix $R_{2}R_{1}^{-1}$ is orthogonal and diagonal.
