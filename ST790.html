<h3><i>Assignments</i></h3>
<br/>
<ul>


<li> Homework 1: Identify one of the six "types of statistics research" that is of interest to you, and find one manuscript that fits within the type you idenified.  In a .tex file, write a few sentences to justify your classification of the paper you found, and include a citation to the paper using a .bib file.  Email me the compiled .pdf file from your .tex file.  
<br/>
Due: beginning of class on 11 September 2024
<br/>
<br>


<li> Homework 2: Read the manuscript: <a href="/ST790/Marron1999.pdf"><b>Marron (1999)</b></a> discussing effective writing in statistics.  Based on Section 3 "Presentation of Mathematics", write up a description of the idea of a bootstrap sampling distribution.  Limit your write-up to not more than 1 page in length, and use whatever combination of words and notation you feel is most readable.  Email me the .pdf file of your write-up.  We will take a look at some of these during lecture, on a volunteer basis.
<br/>
Due: beginning of class on 9 September 2024
<br/>
<br>


<li> Homework 3: To prepare for the PhD student panel on 6 November, formulate and email me at least one question you have for the panel.  The panel will be composed of 5th and 6th year PhD students in the Statistics Department.  Your questions will be kept anonymous, but used by the panel to prepare a short presentation, followed by a live Q&A session where you can ask further questions. 
<br/>
Due: beginning of class on 30 September 2024
<br/>
<br>


<li> Homework 4: Write a literature review on a topic that you might consider working on for your dissertation.  Identify key articles (published or unpublished), and implement a forward and backward citation search on these articles.  Summarize key and relevant articles in the level of depth appropriate for the scope of the simulation study.  Refer back to the lecture slide on "Things to consider in writing a literature review" for guiding remarks/questions.  Identify open research questions related to the topic.
